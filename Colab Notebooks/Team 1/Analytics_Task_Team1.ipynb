As part of this transformation, they have asked our team at OC&C to help **analyse store-level performance drivers** to support better decision-making.\n","\n","### üéØ Objective\n","The goal is to **predict annual sales at the store level** using provided data on store attributes. These predictions will be used to:\n","\n","- Improve the **efficiency of the store portfolio**\n","- Support **strategic expansion** beyond the current store footprint\n","- Help OC&Grocery **reduce food waste** and enhance **customer satisfaction**\n","\n","### üìÇ Provided Data\n","You have access to two datasets:\n","- **Store Data:** Contains various attributes about each store (e.g., location, size, format, etc.)\n","- **Sales Data:** Provides the **annual sales figures** for each store\n","\n","> ‚ö†Ô∏è *Not all store attributes will be relevant, part of your task is to determine which features matter most.*\n","\n","### üß† Your Task\n","1. **Explore and clean** the datasets.\n","2. **Select relevant features** from the store data.\n","3. **Train a predictive model** that estimates annual sales for a subset of stores.\n","4. Evaluate the model's performance and ensure it's suitable for strategic recommendations.\n","\n","> üìù **Reminder:** Focus on balancing your time effectively between **Analytics** and **Strategy**. Avoid over-optimizing the model, spend your time wisely.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"VwN-DKiIaxwR"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":377},"id":"3fXQ2AFzanQG","executionInfo":{"status":"error","timestamp":1744116417922,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":89887,"user":{"displayName":"OCC Stratathon","userId":"10734314324343174806"}},"outputId":"5a806c69-596e-4b73-8319-4f36b5044093"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"],"text/html":["\n","     <input type=\"file\" id=\"files-ed38dd22-cbd4-4782-9223-55e84e0fa658\" name=\"files[]\" multiple disabled\n","        style=\"border:none\" />\n","     <output id=\"result-ed38dd22-cbd4-4782-9223-55e84e0fa658\">\n","      Upload widget is only available when the cell has been executed in the\n","      current browser session.
